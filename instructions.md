The Cat and Dog class implement the Animal interface. All animals have names, but only dogs do tricks. Implement the describe method, using the instanceof operator to test whether the given animal is a dog. If so, return the name, a space, and the trick that the dog can do, such as "Helmut barks at the moon". If it is any other kind of animal, return the name, a space, and "has no tricks".
